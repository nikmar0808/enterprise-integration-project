# FastAPI is built natively on top of the OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger).
# Because we explicitly declared our data contracts using Pydantic and type hints,
# the FastAPI engine dynamically analyzes your code structure at startup.
# It maps out your routers, types, and constraints, compiles them into a standardized JSON configuration file behind the scenes, and
# hosts an embedded web page to read that file.
# APIRouter acts like a mini-ESB router that attaches to the main engine later
# Instead of cluttering your main application file, an APIRouter lets you build isolated groups of endpoints.
# The prefix="/api/v1" means every endpoint inside this file will automatically start with /api/v1 (e.g., /api/v1/transform).
# This is how professional developers version their APIs so they don't break older client integrations when upgrading software.

# FastAPI automatically performs three background steps the moment a request hits the server:
# 1. It captures the raw incoming JSON text stream over the network.
# 2. It parses that text and validates it against every single rule we set up in meter.py
# (like checking if types match and numbers are positive).
# 3. If valid, it hands your function a clean, fully populated Python object ready for use.
# If invalid, it completely drops the connection and generates that detailed error report you saw in Swagger.
